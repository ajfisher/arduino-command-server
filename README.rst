Arduino Command Server
======================

Overview
--------

This library is designed to make it easy to set up a command line server on an arduino that can respond to commands over the wire similar to telnet, FTP or other command line protocols.

Additionally the library is designed to be generic enough to add additional commands to those in the base library in order to extend the server out.

Requirements
------------

A stock Arduino Duemilanove or Uno are only supported at this time Arduino Mega is not properly supported (ie none of the pin counts are correct).

Use
---

At this point, fire up the sketch, load it on the Arduino and connect via a Serial Connection. From there start issuing commands and see what happens.
